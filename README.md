# _The Word Definer_

_2 October 2020_

#### _Ruby Independent Project #2 (for Epicodus)_

#### By _**Drew Parker**_

## Description

_Make an application that contains a Word class. The homepage of the app should list all words. When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions. Children should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add, update or delete one or more definitions. This week you should deploy your application to Heroku so the kids can try it out!_
